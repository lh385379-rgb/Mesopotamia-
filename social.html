<h1>Social Structure</h1>
<a href="index.html">Home</a>

<p>
Mesopotamian society was divided into social classes. At the top were kings
and priests, who held the most power and wealth.
</p>

<p>
Below them were merchants, artisans, and scribes who played important roles
in trade and communication.
</p>

<p>
Farmers made up most of the population, while enslaved people were at the
bottom of the social structure and had few rights.
