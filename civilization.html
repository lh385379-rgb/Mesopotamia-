<h1>Mesopotamian Civilization</h1>
<a href="index.html">Home</a>

<p>
Mesopotamia was located in the Fertile Crescent, a region with rich soil
that allowed early farming to thrive. The availability of water from the
Tigris and Euphrates Rivers helped cities grow.
</p>

<p>
Early Mesopotamian cities such as Ur, Uruk, and Babylon were independent
city-states. Each city-state had its own government, laws, and ruler.
Kings were responsible for protection, law enforcement, and maintaining
order.
</p>

<p>
One of the most famous rulers was Hammurabi, who created Hammurabi’s Code,
one of the earliest written law systems in history.
