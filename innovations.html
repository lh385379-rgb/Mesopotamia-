<p>
Mesopotamians created many inventions that changed human history.
One of the most important was writing, which allowed people to keep records
and pass down knowledge.
</p>

<p>
They also invented the wheel, which improved transportation and trade.
Irrigation systems were built to control water and help crops grow in dry
areas.
</p>

<p>
Mesopotamians developed a base-60 number system, which is why we use
60 minutes in an hour and 360 degrees in a circle.
